# TIP - Token Introspection Proxy

Remote Token Introspection is just a TIP away.


## TODOs:
- Calls to the token introspection must be authenticated, if it is no remote 
  token I can just forward the auth, but if it is a remote introspection I 
  first must verify the auth; it is open how this would be done.
